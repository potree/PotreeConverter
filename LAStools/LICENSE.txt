  There are TWO parts to LAStools. One part is OPEN source (LGPL 2.1). The
  other part is CLOSED source and requires licensing for most commercial
  or government use. If you're unsure please email 'martin@rapidlasso.com'
  before using LAStools. For education and evaluation purposes you can use
  and test LAStools as much as you need to ... (-:

  Personal note: The creator of LAStools and LASzip is currently not able
  to attend LiDAR conferences or other scientific meetings in the US over
  a somewhat unfortunate, kind of silly, and in many ways absurdly funny
  incident involving "laser chickens" and a US Nuclear Weapons Lab. If you
  have enough "pull" to rectify this ridiculous situation we would like to
  hear from you ... (-;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This part of LAStools is "free" open-source LGPL (see COPYING.txt). To
  purchase a different licensing model contact 'license@rapidlasso.com'.
